### Funded!
Haskell.org's _Summer of Haskell_ program is a fantastic initiative that helps spur growth in the community and support learning. You can read more about the program and the other projects [here](https://summer.haskell.org/news.html).

### Moving Forward
Eventually here you'll see a post about about [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and related tools. Nix makes dependency management, build repeatability, and installation a breeze. In the end, we'll be using nix to work with necessary tools and package up the project into something easily usable. We'll talk about what we've done with Nix and then dive into working with GHC.
