## A Very Fun Time
_We've been chosen for funding by Haskell.org as a part of the Summer of Haskell 2017! We'll briefly discuss the implications of this and the content of upcoming posts._  

### Funded!
Haskell.org's _Summer of Haskell_ program is a fantastic initiative that helps spur growth in the community and support learning. You can read more about the program and the other projects [here](https://summer.haskell.org/news.html).  
Being funded means that I'll be able to work on this project full-time this summer. I'd imagine we'll have a working (although not perfectly optimized) product by summer's end.

### Moving Forward
We'll be exploring other tools this project will be using in the miniseries. These posts will assume certain tools are already installed on your system and will discuss very little about installation processes. Eventually here you'll see a post about about [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and related tools. Nix make dependency management, build repeatability, and installation a breeze. In the end, we'll be using nix to work with necessary tools and package up the project into something easily usable. In the meantime, you'll be able to follow along with the miniseries posts by way of manual installation if you wish.
